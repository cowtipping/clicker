## Lessons Learned

- Conditional CSS - applying a different animation on click.
- Using the data attribute in HTML to get values to a div.
- A reminder about why React really doesn't like object mutation when you want to render something.
- Randomly generating messages.
- Using intervals and why you need to clear them.
